# MVP - Discover Music By Country
My MVP creation at Hack Reactor

This website connects you to music from around the globe. Just click a country and you are presented with dozens of musical selections that you can sift through at your leisure. If you find something you like, listening to this selection is simple. Clicking the blue button at the bottom of your screen will take you to that very piece in spotify.

To use:

Fork and clone this repository.

Run "npm install".

In the database file, change the MySQL credentials as needed if running locally.

Thanks for your interest!
